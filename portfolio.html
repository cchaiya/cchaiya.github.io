    <h1> This is my PLTW 1.1.9 Project! My partner and I made a moving illustration of a duck pond that has moving ducks and turtles in it. 
    We created custom classes and definitions within our project in order to streamline efficiency as well as created a suite of custom turtle stamps! We utilized primarily the
    python turtle commands in order to illustrate and create our project. For the pixel art, we used piksel! </h1>

    <h1> This is my PLTW 1.2.5 project! My partner and I made a game inspired by the traditional snake game. Instead of a snake, we have a row of moving ducks
    following a leader duck. We utilized custom definitions in oder to make debugging easier! 
    We also used arrays to append the follower ducks to the leader ducks and streamline efficiency!</h1>
