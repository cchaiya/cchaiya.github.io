    <h1> This is my PLTW 1.1.9 Project! My partner and I made a moving illustration of a duck pond that has moving ducks and turtles in it. 
    We created custom classes and definitions within our project in order to streamline efficiency as well as created a suite of custom turtle stamps! We utilized primarily the
    python turtle commands in order to illustrate and create our project. For the pixel art, we used piksel! </h1>

    <h1> This is my PLTW 1.2.5 project! My partner and I made a game inspired by the traditional snake game. Instead of a snake, we have a row of moving ducks
    following a leader duck. We utilized custom definitions in oder to make debugging easier! 
    We also used arrays to append the follower ducks to the leader ducks and streamline efficiency!</h1>

    <h1> This is our scratch project! My partner and I created a game following the life of a student at our school. We created custom protocols for walking and used counters 
     to track the amount of minigames a player completed! We also used multiple backgrounds and costumes in order to create levels and different areas of the school. There 
     is player input to control the character movement and play minigames. </h1>

    <h1>We thought that the data was from the rocky mountains. 
     This is because the temperature starts off relatively cool and heats up quickly and stays warm. 
     This pattern follows the same pattern of the rocky mountains. The light intensity is very high, but is disrupted frequently, 
     which leads us to believe that maybe clouds were causing the intensity of light to decrease every once in a while. 
     The other regions did not have this feature. The sound was relatively quiet, ranging from =20 to 10 units,
     so we assumed that there was some sort of low and constant type of sound going on. 
     Lastly, the pressure seemed pretty constant with slight variation, so we believed that the wind would have slight variation but to be constant. </h1>
